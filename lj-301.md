#Journal Entry 1 301

Today began our journey through code 301. It is interesting to know we will be pair programming every day with a new partner. Everyone in the class is really easy going so I anticipate all group assignments to go very well. An aspect of 301 that excites me is working with and modifying existing an existing code base. I feel like I have an easier time working with code when I am not starting with a total blank canvas. Today we working on making changes to a blog post that allow it to adapt to different screen sizes such as on a mobile device or on a desktop screen.

Today we learned about Jquery with events. No surprise our lab was to add events to the blog post that we have been working on prior this week. I am amazed with how much unseen magic that goes on with jquery as our buildout today required very little code to be added to the starter code to achieve the desired functionality though it became clear that a strong understanding of whats going on in the other code was a must in order to figure out what jquery is needed. Both Joseph and I got stumped on the setTeaser function. We were close just struggled to figure out how to open just the selected article instead of all of them.

Unfortunately on Friday things did not go according to plan since Sam was too sick to make it in. Also with our TA Ron sick as well he left early we were short a TA as well. We did our best to try and do the lab but it proved to be a bit much for us to figure out. We got part of the way through by asking for help and I started to watch the youtube lecture from the previous class to do this lab before we moved on to doing code review on our portfolios.

Today was a fun day we began to learn about how AJAX and JSON work together. I can really feel the pressure of trying to learn all these different JS libraries and how they work and when to use them and the syntax that comes with them will make just about anyones head spin. Today was a full solar eclipse and was quite the sight to see. For todays assignment I worked together with Ron and although he seemed discouraged we got through the assignment quite quickly. We worked well together.

Yesterday I paired with Mario for our lab assignment. We are focused on learning the full VCM model and the communication between user the server and the database. Other exciting news I decided to go for the ASP.NET 401 after having a small one on with with Amanda the instructor for the course. She seems so passionate and excited for the course so I couldn't help but not be as well. Finished off my evening by finally getting my handelbars to work on my portfolio. It still needs a lot of attention but small victories!!!

Today was quite the busy day. I have been really tired and wiped out for the second half of this week and my brain has been moving about as slow as molasses. I worked with George toady on our assignment and unfortunately we were unable to get much done before he wanted to leave but I managed to knock out a few more TODOs before leaving for the weekend one of which all thanks to Megans help. Plan on getting my self caught up this weekend and rest is really needed.

Today we learned about client side routing. I worked with Erik once again and we got the lab assignment done fairly quickly. For our portfolio assignment it went from a nice working portfolio to a broken as hell portfolio while I try to refactor it to be like our lab assignments. Hearing other peoples are just as broken makes me feel better though.
