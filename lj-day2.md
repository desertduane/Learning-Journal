Today we created an about me page learning how to link together HTML, JS and CSS. I had trouble at first creating my yes/no prompts with JS. But with some help I learned how to properly write out the if/else statement to return the appropriate response to the users input.

After completing the five question prompts I continues to play with HTML and CSS to see how I could style my "about me" page.

Today was my first experience with paired programming and I realized by the end of the day that I had become much better at spotting bugs in the code we have made so far. I spent a good portion of the day helping navigate my partners Daniel and Mario to find and fix the bugs in their code.

Once their code was working as intended we took turns wrapping each others code in functions and ensuring nothing broke in the process. Excited and a bit scared for what lies ahead with functions.

Today was our first time coding using object literals. At least it was for me and man was it a jump in difficulty from previous assignments. Thanks to the collaborative help of fellow students and TAs I have able to leave with working code for my cookie-stand project.

I see now my struggle was that I was not breaking the problem down into small enough parts and did not break down the logic flow properly. Thankfully now with working code the more I look at it the more I am able to understand its flow.

This last week was very difficult! Many moments I thought I was going to have to give up. Through the struggle with a lot of help from fellow students I managed to find my way to working code with a functioning table and form. Now that I see it working it makes much more sense to me than when I was trying to piece it together. I still need a lot of work on really planning out step by step how I solve these problems and building the code in smaller pieces and not just try to shred the whole thing out in one go just to see it full of errors.
