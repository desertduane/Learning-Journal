# Learning Journal Entry 1

Today we created an about me page learning how to link together HTML, JS and CSS. I had trouble at first creating my yes/no prompts with JS. But with some help I learned how to properly write out the if/else statement to return the appropriate response to the users input.

After completing the five question prompts I continues to play with HTML and CSS to see how I could style my "about me" page.
