Today we created an about me page learning how to link together HTML, JS and CSS. I had trouble at first creating my yes/no prompts with JS. But with some help I learned how to properly write out the if/else statement to return the appropriate response to the users input.

After completing the five question prompts I continues to play with HTML and CSS to see how I could style my "about me" page.

Today was my first experience with paired programming and I realized by the end of the day that I had become much better at spotting bugs in the code we have made so far. I spent a good portion of the day helping navigate my partners Daniel and Mario to find and fix the bugs in their code.

Once their code was working as intended we took turns wrapping each others code in functions and ensuring nothing broke in the process. Excited and a bit scared for what lies ahead with functions.

Today was our first time coding using object literals. At least it was for me and man was it a jump in difficulty from previous assignments. Thanks to the collaborative help of fellow students and TAs I have able to leave with working code for my cookie-stand project.

I see now my struggle was that I was not breaking the problem down into small enough parts and did not break down the logic flow properly. Thankfully now with working code the more I look at it the more I am able to understand its flow.

This last week was very difficult! Many moments I thought I was going to have to give up. Through the struggle with a lot of help from fellow students I managed to find my way to working code with a functioning table and form. Now that I see it working it makes much more sense to me than when I was trying to piece it together. I still need a lot of work on really planning out step by step how I solve these problems and building the code in smaller pieces and not just try to shred the whole thing out in one go just to see it full of errors.

On Friday this week I spent most of the day working on putting together the chocolate cookie assignment. I was amazed at how smoothly it went as I almost finished it by the time I had to go home. I realized I found CSS more enjoyable when I had guidelines to follow and knew what I was trying to make. CSS is much more frustrating to me when I am just given a blank canvas with no direction because I get frustrated in trying to figure out what works and what looks good.

Today my group and I experienced a lot of long periods of hitting a wall followed by short bursts of success. Trying to figure out the functions needed to stop duplicate images from appearing in our selection of three was by far the biggest wall to over come today. Next will be trying to get it to count up how many times an image is clicked which unfortunately we did not get to that today.

Today we leaned about how to utilize the local storage in browser to save data for when a page is closed refreshed etc. This may have been the most frustrating day since we searched all day for an answer that turned out to only be 4-5 lines of code.

For our final formal day of class we finally learned who our groups for project week are. I am very pleased with my group as they are hard working folks who together I believe we form a strong coding team. Together as a team we came up with the idea to create a casino war card game for our final project. It still needs approval but I believe this could be a fun challenge and could demonstrate what we have learned over the course of 201. As for todays activity other than beginning to plan our project we worked on preventing merge conflicts while working as a group in github.

Project week for my team has gone about as smooth as I could have expected. It hasn't been without its difficulty aka trying to embed a video into html. I have no idea why I cannot get it to work. I was eventually able to upload them to youtube and link them in that way. As of the end of wednesday our site has all the functionality we initially set out to do plus some extras also our css of the pages is coming along nicely. Thursday is going to be focused on styling and stretch goals.

This week has been a lot of fun. I am so glad to have ended up in a team that worked so well together. We combined our strengths helped pick up each others weaknesses and made a site that we are quite proud of. Very nervous about our presentation tomorrow but excited for wrapping up the first leg of this code fellows journey as it has been a fantastic experience.

Today we wrapped up our 201 journey with the presentations of our projects. Over all I am very satisfied with our project and feel fortunate for being paired with some outstanding guys Gregory and Han. We worked together really well and I could not have asked for a nicer pair of teammates. I was also very impressed with everyone else's projects it is obvious everyone did their best to show off what they know and have learned over this 201 course. I look forward to seeing everyone in 301 and with this group of folks I know we will all make it through.
