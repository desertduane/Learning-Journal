Today we created an about me page learning how to link together HTML, JS and CSS. I had trouble at first creating my yes/no prompts with JS. But with some help I learned how to properly write out the if/else statement to return the appropriate response to the users input.

After completing the five question prompts I continues to play with HTML and CSS to see how I could style my "about me" page.

Today was my first experience with paired programming and I realized by the end of the day that I had become much better at spotting bugs in the code we have made so far. I spent a good portion of the day helping navigate my partners Daniel and Mario to find and fix the bugs in their code.

Once their code was working as intended we took turns wrapping each others code in functions and ensuring nothing broke in the process. Excited and a bit scared for what lies ahead with functions.
